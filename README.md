# Date-Questions-Generator
This Python script fetches a list of random questions to ask on a date from a specified URL and prints a selection of these questions. 
It utilizes requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape questions from a webpage and randomly select a subset of them for display.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```


- The script handles basic error checking for network requests and parsing failures.
- Adjust the number of questions (num_questions) to print more or fewer questions. (max 100 on the given site.)
